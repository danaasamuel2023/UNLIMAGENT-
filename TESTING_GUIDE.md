## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Premium badges not showing
**Solution:** Check that:
- Migration was applied successfully
- Products have `tier = 'premium'` or enhanced features set
- Database columns exist (run verification SQL)

### Issue: API docs page not loading
**Solution:** Check that:
- Dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Port 3000 is not in use
- No console errors in browser

### Issue: Sharing not working on mobile
**Solution:** This is expected if native share API is not supported. The fallback (copy link) should work.

### Issue: Footer overlapping content
**Solution:** Check that pages have proper margin-bottom or min-height to allow footer to display.

## üìù Sample Test Data

If you need test data, use this SQL in Supabase:

```sql
-- Get a store ID to use for testing
SELECT id, store_name, store_slug, status 
FROM agent_stores 
WHERE status = 'active' 
LIMIT 1;

-- Get products for testing
SELECT id, store_id, network, capacity, tier, bundle_type
FROM agent_products
WHERE is_active = true
LIMIT 10;

-- Make a product premium for testing
UPDATE agent_products 
SET 
  tier = 'premium',
  bundle_type = 'UP2U',
  priority_processing = true,
  enhanced_reliability = true,
  faster_delivery = true
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM agent_products LIMIT 1);
```
