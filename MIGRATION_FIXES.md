# üîß Migration File Fixes

This document lists all the errors that were fixed in the database migration file.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Withdrawals Table - Field Name Mismatch**
**Issue:** The migration used `payment_details` but the application code uses `account_details`

**Fixed:** Changed line 272 from:
```sql
payment_details JSONB NOT NULL,
```
to:
```sql
account_details JSONB NOT NULL,
```

---

### 2. **Transactions Table - Field Name Mismatch**
**Issue:** The migration used `agent_profit` but the application code uses `profit`

**Fixed:** Changed line 205 from:
```sql
agent_profit DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
```
to:
```sql
profit DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
```

---

### 3. **Transactions Table - Missing `mb` Field**
**Issue:** The application code uses an `mb` field to store capacity in MB, but it wasn't in the migration

**Fixed:** Added line 199:
```sql
mb INTEGER,
```

---

### 4. **Transactions Table - Missing `customer_message` Field**
**Issue:** The application code uses `customer_message` to capture customer notes during order placement, but it wasn't in the migration

**Fixed:** Added line 228:
```sql
customer_message TEXT,
```

---

### 5. **Removed Invalid Trigger**
**Issue:** The migration created a trigger for `update_agent_transactions_updated_at` but the `agent_transactions` table doesn't have an `updated_at` column

**Fixed:** Removed lines 482-483 (the trigger for agent_transactions)

---

## üìù Summary

All field names in the database migration now match what the application code expects:

- ‚úÖ `account_details` (not `payment_details`)
- ‚úÖ `profit` (not `agent_profit`)
- ‚úÖ `mb` field added for capacity in megabytes
- ‚úÖ `customer_message` field added for customer notes
- ‚úÖ Invalid trigger removed for `agent_transactions`

---

## üöÄ Migration Ready

The migration file is now ready to run without errors. The database schema will match all application code expectations.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **If you already ran the migration**, you'll need to alter the existing tables:
   ```sql
   -- Fix withdrawals table
   ALTER TABLE agent_withdrawals RENAME COLUMN payment_details TO account_details;
   
   -- Fix transactions table
   ALTER TABLE agent_transactions RENAME COLUMN agent_profit TO profit;
   ALTER TABLE agent_transactions ADD COLUMN mb INTEGER;
   ALTER TABLE agent_transactions ADD COLUMN customer_message TEXT;
   
   -- Drop invalid trigger
   DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_agent_transactions_updated_at ON agent_transactions;
   ```

2. **If you haven't run the migration yet**, you can proceed with running the fixed migration file directly.
