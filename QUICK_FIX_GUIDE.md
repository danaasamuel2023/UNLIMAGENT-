# Quick Fix Guide - Withdrawal Error

## Current Issue
"Failed to update withdrawal" error when processing withdrawals.

## Solution (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Apply Database Fix (Required)

**Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor → Run this:**

```sql
-- Quick fix for agent_withdrawals table
DO $$ 
BEGIN
    -- Make payment_details nullable
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_schema = 'public'
        AND table_name = 'agent_withdrawals' 
        AND column_name = 'payment_details'
        AND is_nullable = 'NO'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE agent_withdrawals ALTER COLUMN payment_details DROP NOT NULL;
        UPDATE agent_withdrawals SET payment_details = '{}' WHERE payment_details IS NULL;
    END IF;
    
    -- Ensure account_details exists
    ALTER TABLE agent_withdrawals ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS account_details JSONB;
    UPDATE agent_withdrawals SET account_details = '{}' WHERE account_details IS NULL;
    ALTER TABLE agent_withdrawals ALTER COLUMN account_details SET NOT NULL;
    ALTER TABLE agent_withdrawals ALTER COLUMN account_details SET DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;
END $$;
```
