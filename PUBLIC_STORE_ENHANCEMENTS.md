## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Apply the migration to add the `store_logo_url` column:

```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI
psql -f supabase/migrations/004_add_store_logo.sql
```

### Step 2: Create Storage Bucket (Required)

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Storage**
2. Click **"Create bucket"**
3. Bucket name: `agent-assets`
4. **Make it public** (for public access to logos)
5. Save

Alternatively, run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('agent-assets', 'agent-assets', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 3: Configure Storage Policies

Allow authenticated agents to upload to `agent-assets`:

```sql
-- Create policy for agent logo uploads
CREATE POLICY "Agents can upload logos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'agent-assets' 
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'store-logos'
);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view logos"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'agent-assets');
```

### Step 4: Restart Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
