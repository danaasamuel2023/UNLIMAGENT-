## 🚀 How It Works

### Customer Journey:
1. **Sign Up/Login**: User creates account or logs in
2. **Deposit Funds**: 
   - Go to `/payment/deposit`
   - Enter amount (min: GHS 1, max: GHS 50,000)
   - Pay via Paystack (mobile money, card, etc.)
   - Balance updates automatically
3. **Browse Stores**: View products on agent stores
4. **Purchase**:
   - See wallet balance on product cards
   - Click "Purchase Now"
   - If sufficient balance: Pay with wallet → Order fulfilled automatically
   - If insufficient: Redirected to deposit with shortfall amount
5. **Auto-Delivery**: Data bundle sent to customer's phone

### Agent Journey:
1. Orders appear in dashboard as before
2. **Paid Orders** (payment_status: 'paid'):
   - Status: "processing"
   - Automatically fulfilled via Data Mart API
   - Customer receives bundle immediately
3. **Unpaid Orders** (payment_status: 'pending'):
   - Status: "pending"
   - Agent collects payment offline
   - Agent manually fulfills order
   - Updates order status to "completed"

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ RLS policies: Customers can only access their own wallets
- ✅ Balance validation: Prevents overdrafts
- ✅ Transaction locks: Atomic operations
- ✅ Payment verification: Paystack webhooks
- ✅ Reference tracking: Unique transaction IDs

## 📊 Database Structure

```sql
customer_wallets:
  - id, user_id, phone_number
  - balance (available)
  - total_deposits, total_spent
  - status

customer_transactions:
  - id, wallet_id, user_id
  - type (deposit/purchase/refund)
  - amount, balance_before, balance_after
  - reference, status
  - payment_gateway, metadata
```

## 💰 Payment Flow

### Deposit Flow:
1. User enters amount
2. API creates transaction with status: 'pending'
3. Paystack payment initialized
4. User completes payment
5. Callback verifies with Paystack
6. Transaction marked: 'completed'
7. Wallet balance updated (trigger)
8. User redirected to success page

### Purchase Flow:
1. User clicks "Purchase Now"
2. API checks wallet balance
3. If sufficient:
   - Deduct amount from wallet
   - Create customer_transaction (type: 'purchase')
   - Create agent_transaction (payment_status: 'paid')
   - Auto-fulfill via Data Mart API
   - Status: 'processing' → 'completed'
4. If insufficient:
   - Show error with shortfall
   - Link to deposit page

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

1. **Balance Display**: Shows current balance on product cards
2. **Smart Buttons**: 
   - "Pay with Wallet" when balance is sufficient
   - "Add Funds" when balance is low
   - "Pay via Mobile Money" as fallback
3. **Auto-Fulfillment**: Instant delivery for paid orders
4. **Error Handling**: Clear messages for insufficient balance

## 🔄 Migration Steps

1. **Apply migration**:
```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor:
# Run contents of supabase/migrations/003_customer_wallet_system.sql
```

2. **Add environment variables**:
```env
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
```

3. **Test flow**:
- Deposit → Purchase → Auto-fulfillment
