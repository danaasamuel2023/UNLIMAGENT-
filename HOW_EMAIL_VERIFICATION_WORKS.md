# ✉️ How Email Verification Works - ACTIVE SYSTEM

## 🎯 Complete Active Flow

### Step 1: User Signs Up (`/signup`)
```
User fills form → Submits → Supabase sends email → Redirects to /verify-email
```
**Active Code:** `app/signup/page.tsx` lines 41-56

### Step 2: Email Sent Automatically
- **Email contains:** Unique verification token
- **Link format:** `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback?code=TOKEN&next=/dashboard`
- **Action:** User clicks the link in their email

### Step 3: Verification Processing
```
User clicks link → /auth/callback → Supabase verifies token → Session created
```
**Active Code:** `app/auth/callback/route.ts` lines 6-16

### Step 4: Account Verified
- User is redirected to dashboard
- Can now log in and access protected routes
- Email is marked as confirmed in database

**Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
```
Authentication → Email Templates → Confirm signup
```

**Update the URL to:**
```html
{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/callback?next=/dashboard
```

**Add Redirect URL:**
```
Project Settings → Auth → Redirect URLs
Add: http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
```

### 2. Test the Flow:

1. **Visit:** `http://localhost:3003/signup`
2. **Enter details:**
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: your-real-email@gmail.com
   - Role: Agent
   - Password: test123
3. **Click "Sign up"**
4. **Check your email** for verification link
5. **Click the link** in the email
6. **Should redirect** to dashboard (`/dashboard`)

## 📧 Email Configuration Status

### Default (Development):
- ✅ Supabase sends emails automatically
- ⚠️ May be slow (3 emails/hour limit on free tier)
- ⚠️ Might go to spam folder

### To Improve (Production):
1. Add custom SMTP in Supabase
2. Configure email provider (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
3. Add SPF/DKIM records for better delivery

## 🔍 What Happens Behind the Scenes:

### When User Clicks Verification Link:

1. **Browser:** Opens `/auth/callback?code=abc123`
2. **Server:** Extracts code from URL
3. **Supabase:** Verifies the token is valid
4. **Database:** Updates user email_confirmed = true
5. **Session:** Creates authenticated session
6. **Redirect:** Sends user to `/dashboard`

All handled automatically! No manual steps needed.
